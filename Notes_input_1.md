# INTRO GenAI
- define, explain, describe genai
- model types and applications
- content: text imagery audio, synthetic data

## what is ai, difference ml
ai is computer science of agents, theory method,
machine learning, trains model, useful predictions.
ability to learn without explicit programming
## supervised and unsupervised
- data model input
### supervised
- labeled data
- past examples predict future values.
- model predicted output compared to expected output | error
- train data does not match predicted data = effor
- model reduce error until predicted and training are closer
### unsupervised 
- discovery, cluster, natural groups
- unlabeled data - generated example
## DEEP LEARING
- subset of ML
- more complex patterns.
-  use artificial neural networks (neuron)
- more complex patterns.
### supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, deep learning.
- learn to perform tasks, by process data, and make prediction.
- Input Layer, Hidden Layer, Output Layer.
# CHARTS ( ARTIFICIAL_NEURAL_NETWORKS )
 - network, sankey, edge bundling, force-directed.
 - many layers of neruons.
## SEMI SUPERVISED LEARNING 
- use both labeled and unlabled data (sankey)
- trained on small labeled data and large unlabled data
- basic concepts to general examples.
# GENERATIVE AI
- subset of ML & Deep Learning
## Large language models
-  also subset of deep learning.
## Discriminative and Generative Deep Learning Models.
### Discriminitive
- classify and predict from labeled data points
- learn relationship between data points by labels
- conditional probability distribution (y)
- different kinds
### Generative
- generates new data from training data
- learned probability distribution
- instances from existing data (new content)
- mimics distribution
- word prediction
- joint probability distribution (y)
- different instances
### how it works
probability of output based on input
probability this is a dog.
discriminate dog, generalize dog, 
joint dog, instance dog. probability prediction.
### Predictive ML Model
- Learns relationship between data lables.
- Purpose to label (classify) content
### GenAI Model
- learns patterns in unstructured content.
- to create new content..
### NOT GENAI
- number, class, probability
### GenAI Specific
- ML SYSTEM OUTPUT
- Image, Audio, Natural Language
y = f(x)
output = model(input)
// Factory Pattern
## History of MODEL BUILDING
- predict, classify, cluster
- TRAINING CODE & LABEL DATA
# GENAI Meoldel Building
## Foundation Model
- built from Train code, hybrid data
- new: code, text, image, audio, video
# GENERATIVE MODELS
- LaMDA (Language Model Dialog Apps)
- PaLM (Pathways Language Model), GPT
- foundation language by asking question.
## steps to genai
1. create content from learn existing content training
2. statistical model from prompt, 
3. predicts response might be
4. generates new instances and examples
### secret sauce
- statistical model predicts expected response.
- new samples similar to trained data
- applied to audio, imagery, video.
### LANGUAGE INPUT
- patterns in language, predict whats next
- what comes next...
### IMAGE INPUT
- diffusion of model
- transform with random noise into images
### OUTPUT TEXT
- translate, summary, q&a, grammer
### OUTPUT IMAGE
- diffusion, video animation, interpolation
### OUTPUT AUDIO
- text to speech
### OUTPUT DECISIONS
- gamification
# PATTERN MATCHING SYSTEMS
## TRANSFORMERS
 - encoder, decoder, representation of task
 - generative pretrained transformer model
 - output
### hallucinations
- noisy or dirty data, constraints, 
### prompt input 
- prompt design  (desired output)
- key words, summary, style
## MODEL TYPES
### Text-to-text
- NLP input, trained by mapping texts
- Generation, Classification, Summarization, Translation, ReSearch, Extraction, Clustering, ReWriting
### Text-to_image
- captions, descriptions, diffusion.
- generation and editing
### Text-to-video Text-to_3D
interpolation.
### Text-to-task
- answer, search, predict, act
- web search / change doc
- agents, assistant, automation
### Adaptation (fine-tuning)
- q & a, sentiment, extraction, caption, recognition, instruction.
- new industries: finance
